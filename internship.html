            <h1>Internship at Epirus</h1>
            <p id="overviewtext"><a href="https://www.epirusinc.com/">Epirus</a> is a company that specializes in the field of counter-UAS (unmanned aerial systems) by way of directed microwaves. The goal of the company is to counter the asymmetric threat of weaponized drones, which are cheap and relatively straightforward to build, but very difficult to counter with current solutions that depend on jamming, nets, or even lethal bullets. Microwaves, on the other hand, can be used to fry the electronics inside a drone, safely disabling it with impressive range. Epirus has two flagship products: Leonidas (counter-UAS), and SmartPower (AI-driven efficient power management systems).</p>
            <br />
            <p>During my time at Epirus, I helped lead the mechanical development of an initial proof of concept for a compact wide-band waveguide chamber. I also developed a rotable shipping container that will be used to transport and deliver the company's flagship product to customers safely and conveniently. Additionally, I assisted in maintaining the 3D printers and assisting those who used them, along with completing various mechanical projects to support the development of counter-UAS technology. This included creating an accurate 1:25 scale model of our company’s flagship product to demonstrate functions to potential customers. Finally, I assisted in testing and repairing drones, training field representatives, and also became a certified remote pilot under the FAA.</p>

            <h1>Caltech SURF at CAST Robotics</h1>
            <p id="overviewtext">During Summer of 2020, I was a remote summer intern for CAST Robotics as a part of Caltech's Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowship (SURF) program. I was tasked with designing two systems to demonstrate fuel transfer between two 3-degree-of-freedom (3DOF) spacecraft simulators developed at CAST. This then moved into performing simulations in MATLAB. For more information, here's a link to my <a href="https://youtu.be/csShpmsHiCY" target="_blank" class="evaluation">final presentation</a>, and my <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1wClyt1N715w9stv7HBsUqoqIrPaZEwS0/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank" class="evaluation">final report.<a> The abstract for my project is given below.</p>
            <br />

            <p>Satellites developed over the past few decades have had their functionality greatly restricted by their notably short lifespans of around five to fifteen years, often attributed to their limited fuel capacity. As a result, otherwise functional satellites get retired and thrown into graveyard orbits to then be replaced by brand new satellites. This is incredibly time-consuming, costly, and less than ideal. The aim of this project is to develop a proof-of-concept system that can demonstrate the extension of a satellite’s lifespan through in-orbit refueling. This system will be designed around the spacecraft simulators developed at the Center for Autonomous Systems and Technologies lab at Caltech. A compatible fuel arm is designed in SOLIDWORKS, then an expression for a time-dependent moment of inertia tensor is derived based on the flow of fuel from one spacecraft to the other and simulated in MATLAB. This, and similar simulations, will allow for the spacecraft controller boards to take the changing moment of inertia into account for precise movement control. Further work would consist of building proof-of-concept systems for other areas of autonomous servicing, such as replacing parts on a satellite or adding components to it to expand its capabilities.</p>

            <h1>IBM Poughkeepsie Internship</h1>
            <p id="overviewtext">Starting on July 2018, I took a 7-week-long internship at IBM Poughkeepsie. I worked in buildng 706 in the SSD/Flash/Memory Development lab using 3D Printing, CAD Design, and electronic circuits to aid in the testing of SSD/Flash/Memory modules. I worked on various projects throughout my internship that would each, in some form, be used to improve the testing method of these modules. During my time there, I picked up many technical skills and learned to work in a true workplace environment. Along the way, I refined many professional "soft" skills in addition to meeting many great people who taught me all sorts of intersting things. At the end of it all, I gave a brief 6 minute presentation and won the Inventor/Innovation award. <a href="https://drive.google.com/open?id=15Tcw2N8rrAtiuUXRqt8HdeZy2ifKCd6FKBSbE3f-HHI" target="_blank" class="evaluation">Here's a link to my final evaluation</a> from my supervisors Tsung Yeung and Steven Wilson (Opens in new tab).</p>

                            <p>One of the first things I did was to use the Printrbot 3D printers to print upgrades for themselves (better fan shroud, better cooler, strain relief)</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/driveblock.jpg"/>
                            <p>My first major project was to improve the design of a drive block fixture that allowed the use of a cable instead of an actual drive for testing.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/driveblockfusion.png"/>
                            <p>I used Autodesk Fusion 360 for my CAD 3D Modelling. Here's the 3D model file (STL Format). The projected design time was 2 weeks; The model was done by the end of the first week.</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/driveblockcura.png"/>
                            <p>In order to actually print the 3D Models, I used a slicer program called Cura, by Ultimaker. A slicing program converts the 3D STL file to machine language that the 3D printer can actually understand.</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/drivecooler.jpg"/>
                            <p>My next major project was a cooling fixture for Solid State Drive (SSD) testing. This was important as it is best practice to keep computer components at an appropriate temperature.</p>

                            <p>For some context, here was the previous cooling setup.</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/results.png"/>
                            <p>Here's a graph showing the difference between the old and new cooling setup.</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/relayboard.jpg"/>
                            <p>Eventually I branched off into electronics. I learned how to write schematics and apply Ohm's law calculations to create a relay box that could power on/off two power supplies indepentantly.</p>
                        </div>
                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/relaybox.jpg"/>
                            <p>I also designed and 3D printed a casing for it.</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/pcicooler.jpg"/>
                            <p>One of my later projects was an overhead cooler for PCIe storage drives. This quite the design challenge as the cooler had to not interfere with the insertion and removal of the drive, not interfere with other parts of the case, and be printed in small parts. It turned out great!</p>

                        <div class="slide"><img src="images/internship/presentation.png"/>
                            <p>On the final day of the internship, I gave a 6-minute presentation discussing my experience and what I learned. Shortly after, I was given the Inventor/Innovation Award.</p>

                            <p>This is the award that I was nominated for and won at the end of the internship. It rewards the use of problem solving, designing, and fabricating to increase efficiency in the workplace.</p>
