            <h1>My Swimming Career</h1>
            <p id="overviewtext">When I was in the middle of elementary school, I joined a club swim team called Newburgh Sharks after my older brother found out how much he enjoyed it. Toward the end of 5th grade, however, I had to get surgery after it was discovered that I had appendicitis. This pulled me out of swimming for around 4 months. Soon after, I got second degree burns on my ankle and had to be pulled out for about a month. Eventually I stopped getting injured and joined the school varsity team in 8th grade, and have been on both the club team and varsity team year-round, practicing two hours a day (minus transportation), and showing up in the local newspaper multiple times.</p>
