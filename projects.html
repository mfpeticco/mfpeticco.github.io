            <h1>Portable Wii</h1>
            <p>The Nintendo Wii is the third most popular home game console in the world. Chances are, you've picked up a wii remote and played a round of Wii Sports bowling, Super Mario Bros, or some other fun game. There's one *big* problem, though: it's tethered to you living room TV in a nest of cables and wires. My goal for this project was to pack the Wii into a thin tablet form factor with a integrated display that could be moved around taken anywhere, needing just one single cable to play.

            <h1>3-Axis Camera Stabilizing Gimbal</h1>
            <p>For a majority of us, the best camera we own happens to be one we carry around with us at all times- our smartphones. However, with such a small form factor, every minor hand movement gets translated into the phone, causing videos to be a shaky mess. Camera gimbals make corrections for hand movements on 3 axis to produce buttery smooth video - typically for upwards of 300 dollars. I can't afford that, so I decided to make my own, for less.</p>

            <h1>3D Printing and Designing</h1>
            <p>By far the most useful tool that I have that helps me create many of my projects is my 3D Printer. Being able to turn a digital file into a physical, tangible object is not something to be taken lightly. Unfortunately, the models I need for my specific projects are almost never online, so I end using 3D Computer Aided Design (CAD) Programs to make the models. Learn more on my 3D Printing page.</p>

            <h1>Robotics/Combat Robotics</h1>
            <p>I joined the robotics team my freshman year in which we participated in the First Tech Challenge. Soon after sophmore year, though, my interest shifted over to combat robotics. Combat robotics is a sport that involves builders using all aspects of STEM to build robots that are capable of combat with one another. I recently got interested in this because it's a rigorous designing and engineering challenge, and I love making stuff.

            <h1>PC Building</h1>
            <p>Ever since I had built my first PC in 7th Grade, I've come to greatly enjoy picking out parts for, building, and setting upcomputers. I've guided many people through the daunting task of building their own computer, making sure to teach them along the way. Read more about it by checking out my PC Building page. (COMING SOON)</p>

            <h1>Video Editing and 3D Modelling</h1>
            <p>I use programs such as Cinema 4D, Boujou, Adobe After Effects, and photoshop to design and render 3D models. This photo is a render I created of my bathroom to get an idea of what it would look like before we renovated it.</p>
