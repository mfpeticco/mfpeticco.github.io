            <h1>Portable Wii</h1>
            <p>The Nintendo Wii is the third most popular home game console in the world. Chances are, you've picked up a wii remote and played a round of Wii Sports bowling, Super Mario Bros, or some other fun game. There's one *big* problem, though: it's tethered to you living room TV in a nest of cables and wires. My goal for this project was to pack the Wii into a thin tablet form factor with a integrated display that could be moved around taken anywhere, needing just one single cable to play.

            <h1>Drones + Part 107</h1>
            <p>Ever since I got my first drone toward the beginning of high school (a 20$ drone from Amazon which now lives at the bottom of the Hudson River), I have been fascinated with their design, construction and use for both practical and recreational purposes. To date, I have built an FPV (first person view) racing drone, a drone that uses a gimbal-mounted smartphone as a camera, and a compact GoPro Karma competitor.</p>

            <h1>3-Axis Camera Stabilizing Gimbal</h1>
            <p>For a majority of us, the best camera we own happens to be one we carry around with us at all times- our smartphones. However, with such a small form factor, every minor hand movement gets translated into the phone, causing videos to be a shaky mess. Camera gimbals make corrections for hand movements on 3 axis to produce buttery smooth video - typically for upwards of 300 dollars. I can't afford that, so I decided to make my own, for less.</p>

            <h1>Tombclone / Combat Robotics</h1>
            <p>Combat robotics is a sport in which radio controlled vehicles attempt to disable one another in the span of a 3 minute match. This sport was popularized by the television show "Battlebots" which is where I first learned about it. I recently completed a project in which I built a 30-pound replica of the robot "Tombstone" from the show. My next project is to build a 3 pound compat robot to compete in the "Beetleweight" weight class.</p>

OPI 2020 was Doctor Who themed, and I embarked on a project to create life-size 6ft model replica of a Dalek. Click the button to learn more!</p>

I've guided many people through the daunting task of building their own computer, making sure to teach them along the way. Read more about it by checking out my PC Building page. (COMING SOON)</p>
