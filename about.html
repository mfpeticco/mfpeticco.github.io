            <p>My name is Martin Peticco. Welcome to my *new* website, which I designed and coded myself. You'll find much of everything there is to know about me and my life up until now as you continue to click/tap around. For now, know that I am a 17 year old high school senior at Newburgh Free Academy (NFA) in the Excelsior/Newburgh PTECH Program. This is a program that, in partnership with SUNY Orange and IBM, allows students to take true college courses throughout high school and even in the summer. Engineering is my passion.</p>

            <h1>Interest in Engineering Applied</h1>
            <p>Many people enjoy learning about technology and knowing how things work. To stand out, however, one must be able to put what they've learned thus far into a tangible product, whether it be a computer program, a physical electronics project, or some combination of the two. I personally enjoy working on personal projects to practice the engineering process along with more specific professional skills, such as collaboration and communication for the times that I work with others.

            <h1>Activities</h1>
            <p>Participating in extracurricular activities is important for getting experience in collaboration with a team. I have taken part in several extracurriculars and been a part of multiple clubs thus far in my high school career, such as the swim team, NFA Robotics, NFA Student Tech Team, various academic societies, and multiple volunteering opportunities. More on this can be found on my Activities page.</p>

            <h1>Academics/Awards</h1>
            <p>My natural strive to go above and beyond what is typically expected of me has resulted in the winning of numerous awards and honors throughout my academic career. I find significance in every one of these awards, as they are only given to people have constantly worked to raise themselves higher and higher above the crowd, and I'm glad to be a part of that select few. I can attribute part of this to the unusual high school setting/program I am in that very few have had the oppoutinity to do, with even less taking full advantage.

            <h1>Internship</h1>
            <p>During my Summer break of 2018, I had a seven-week internship at IBM Pougkeepsie in which I used 3D Printing, 3D CAD modelling, and circuit boards to aid in the testing of solid state drives (SSD's) for server storage. These drives were being extensively tested as they were going to be placed in IBM's flagship Z series servers and sent out to customers. I expanded my technical skills, in addition to my workplace professional skills while doing this. More information can be found on my Internship page.</p>
