            <p>My name is Martin Peticco. I am a mechanical engineering undergraduate student at the California Institute of Technology (Caltech). Welcome to my website, designed and coded by me. You'll find much of everything there is to know about me and my life up until now as you continue to click or tap around. I was a part of the Newburgh PTECH (Formerly "Excelsior") Program at Newburgh Free Academy, a program that allows students to take true college courses throughout high school and the summer. Engineering is my passion.</p>

            <h1>Interest in Engineering Applied</h1>
            <p>Many people enjoy learning about technology and knowing how things work. To stand out, however, one must be able to put what they've learned thus far into a tangible product, whether it be a computer program, a physical electronics project, or some combination of the two. I enjoy working on personal engineering projects to expand my skillset. You can read about them on my Hobbies and Projects page.</p>

            <h1>Activities</h1>
            <p>Participating in extracurricular activities is important for getting experience in collaborating within a team. I have taken part in several extracurriculars and been a part of multiple clubs thus far in my high school and college career, such as my high school swim team, high school and college robotics teams, various academic societies, and multiple volunteering opportunities. More on this can be found on my Activities page.</p>
